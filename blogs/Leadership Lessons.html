                      Starting a company at 15 in a country where youth leadership is often underestimated was not easy. When I founded Cornor Tech, my goal wasn't just to build a company, but to solve real problems in the tech world—from overpriced services to unaffordable education.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-details-text">
                      The journey was filled with risks, failures, doubt, and growth. Along the way, I discovered what leadership truly means—beyond just managing a team. Here are the five biggest leadership lessons I learned building Cornor Tech.

                      From teachers laughing at my startup to banks refusing my company account, I've heard it all. But I realized: criticism is often a sign you're doing something different. Now that Cornor Tech is legally strong and widely trusted, the same people admire the work I once got mocked for.

                        1. Leadership Is About Standing Tall When You're Alone
                      </h4>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        There was a point where I had no team, no profits, and almost no hope. But leadership showed me that you don't quit in crisis—you push through it. When others leave, you keep going. That mindset helped me rebuild Cornor Tech from scratch.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text m-0">
                        True leadership isn't about having followers; it's about having the courage to continue when you're standing alone. The darkest moments often precede the greatest breakthroughs, and a leader's job is to maintain faith even when the path forward isn't clear.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content-widget">
                      <h4 class="blog-content-widget-title">
                        2. Your Vision Must Be Bigger Than Your Pain
                      </h4>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        The market lacked affordable digital services and inclusive education. I launched Cornor Tech and later Cornor Academy to solve those exact problems. I learned that if your vision helps people and solves real issues, no setback can stop you for long.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        When your purpose is rooted in serving others, it becomes easier to endure personal struggles. The pain of building something meaningful is temporary, but the impact of your vision can last generations.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text m-0">
                        Every challenge I faced became fuel for my mission. Instead of asking "Why is this happening to me?" I started asking "How can this experience help me serve others better?" This shift in perspective transformed obstacles into opportunities.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content-widget">

                        3. Great Leaders Build Great Teams
                      </h4>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        Initially, I didn't know how to delegate or hire. After my first team collapsed, I focused on building a board of people who believed in the same mission. Leadership means hiring people smarter than you and trusting them to do their best.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        The ego of wanting to do everything yourself is the enemy of scale. I learned that true strength comes from admitting what you don't know and surrounding yourself with experts who complement your weaknesses.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text m-0">
                        Building a team isn't just about skills—it's about shared values and vision. When everyone believes in the same mission, individual talents multiply into collective impact. Your role as a leader is to align these talents toward a common goal.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content-widget">

                        4. Ignore the Noise, Trust the Work
                      </h4>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        From teachers laughing at my startup to banks refusing my company account saying "Babu ho, aba company kholcha?", I've heard it all. But I realized: criticism is often a sign you're doing something different. Now that Cornor Tech is legally strong and widely trusted, the same people admire the work I once got mocked for.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        The world is full of people who will tell you what's impossible. But innovation happens when you focus on the work rather than the opinions. Let your results speak louder than your critics.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text m-0">
                        Consistency in execution beats sporadic bursts of inspiration. While others debated whether my ideas would work, I was busy making them work. The market doesn't care about your age or background—it only cares about value delivered.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content-widget">

                        5. Leadership Is Service
                      </h4>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        Cornor Tech wasn't built for profit alone. From day one, we offered free services to struggling businesses, scholarships to girls, and training for low-income students. Leadership is about impact, not income. We helped others rise—and through that, we rose too.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text">
                        Apart from leading Cornor Tech, I serve as Secretary in multiple organizations: Namaste Nepal Youth Club, ICT Kalika, LEP Club Bhirkuti Town, and CIDEW Nepal. Through these roles, I provide free online training, mentor youth, and promote tech literacy, especially among girls and economically challenged youth.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text m-0">
                        True leadership creates more leaders, not more followers. When you lift others up, you create a ripple effect that extends far beyond your immediate reach. The legacy of a leader isn't measured by what they achieved, but by how many others they empowered to achieve.
                      </p>

                        Final Thought
                      </h4>
                      <p class="blog-cont-widget-text m-0">
                        Leadership isn't just about being the face of a brand. It's about failing, learning, building, and serving. If you're young and full of ideas—don't wait for permission. Get trained. Get started. And lead the way. The world needs more young leaders who are willing to solve real problems and create meaningful impact.
